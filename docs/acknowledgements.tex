\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Dr. Lydia Sam, Matthew Logan, Rona Mackay, and Dr. David
R. Green for their guidance during this project. Thanks to Lydia for always
being available for a conversation and for patiently assisting me in obtaining
ethical approval from the university to conduct part of my research. Thanks to
Matthew and Community Energy Scotland for offering me the opportunity to work
on this research project in collaboration with them and for the helpful advice,
including putting me in touch with community landowners. Many thanks to the
community landowners of the Isle of Lewis for taking their time to participate
in this project and providing valuable local knowledge. Finally, I would like
to thank my family for their support and encouragement.
