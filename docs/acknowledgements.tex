\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Dr. Lydia Sam, Matthew Logan, Rona Mackay, and Dr. David R. Green for their guidance during this project. Thanks to Lydia for always being available for a conversation and for patiently assisting me in obtaining ethical approval from the university to conduct part of my research. Thanks to Matthew and Community Energy Scotland for offering me the opportunity to work on this research project with them and for the helpful advice, including putting me in touch with community land owners. Many thanks to the community land owners of the Isle of Lewis for taking their time to participate in this project and providing valuable qualitative inputs. Finally, I would like to thank my family for their support and encouragement.
